# Optimized-Design-of-Soft-Actuators

1. The m file named "OptimizedDesignofSPA_Torque_Bending_Controllability" is programmed to search the optimal parameters of soft pneumatic actuators. The objective functions are obtained by mechanical analysis. The constraint ranges can be tailored to users' requirement including dimensions of soft actuators.

2.  The m file "SoftActuator_verify" is to pre-check the optimal parameters before fabrications. Users can check the torque and bending generated by the corresponding parameters.
